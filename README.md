# Asynchronous_JS_Project_with_5_Solutions
The mini project produces a webpage when click the "view all the people" button. It shows astronauts info utilizing Asynchronous function with four solutions: Async-Await, Fetch,  xhr with plane promise, xhr with callback, xhr without callback.

# How it worksï¼š
The webpage grabbing data through [Open APIs From Space](http://open-notify.org/) and [Wikimedia REST API](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/#/). I tried to put it in the git page, but since the git page was loaded over HTTPS and my API site is using HTTP, I failed to show it through git page here currently(if you could share some good idea to fix this problem, plz comment or pull requests to support, thanks first!). But I will show it in the gif here :P
The final effects show as follows:
